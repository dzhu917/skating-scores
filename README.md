# skating-scores

This project combines two of my interests, figure skating and data visualization, to analyze the trends in competitive figure skating scores on both the national and international circuits. While millions of viewers tune into watch figure skating during the Winter Olympics, much fewer people understand the nuances of IJS (International Judging System) scoring, the current scoring system used to judge all international competitions sanctioned by the ISU (International Skating Union). This system replaced the previous 6.0 system beginning in 2004-05 season as an attempt to make judging more objective in response to the 2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal. I was interested in exploring how truly unbiased this updated system is by looking at scores over the years and examining factors such as home country and host nation.
